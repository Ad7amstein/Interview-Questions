Supervised and unsupervised learning are two of the most common approaches in machine learning, and the main difference lies in whether or not the training data contains **labels**.

### Supervised Learning  

{: .box-success}  

- **Definition:** The algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning each training example is paired with an output (target/label).  
- **Goal:** To predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.  
- **Examples of tasks:**  
  - Classification (spam detection, disease prediction)  
  - Regression (price prediction, sales forecasting)  

**Example:** Training a model with housing data (features like size, location, number of rooms) and their actual prices (labels). The model learns the mapping between features and prices to predict prices of new houses.

### Unsupervised Learning  

{: .box-note}  

- **Definition:** The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, where only the input features are provided without any target labels.  
- **Goal:** To discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings in the data.  
- **Examples of tasks:**  
  - Clustering (customer segmentation, grouping documents)  
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA for visualization or noise reduction)  

**Example:** Feeding customer purchase history into a clustering algorithm to automatically group customers into segments (e.g., frequent buyers vs occasional buyers).

### Key Differences  

| Aspect              | Supervised Learning                          | Unsupervised Learning                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Data**            | Labeled data (features + target)             | Unlabeled data (only features)             |
| **Goal**            | Predict outcomes                            | Find hidden patterns/structure             |
| **Common Tasks**    | Classification, Regression                   | Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction       |
| **Examples**        | Spam detection, house price prediction       | Market segmentation, anomaly detection     |

### Quick Analogy

Think of supervised learning like a **student learning with a teacher** (answers/labels are provided).  
Unsupervised learning is like a **student exploring without guidance**, finding patterns on their own.
