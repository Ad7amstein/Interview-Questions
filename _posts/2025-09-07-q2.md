### 1. **Clustering Algorithms**  

{: .box-success}  

- **K-Means Clustering** – partitions data into *k* groups based on similarity.  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** – builds a hierarchy of clusters (tree-like structure).  
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** – groups points that are closely packed and marks outliers.

### 2. **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms**  

{: .box-note}  

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components.  
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** – visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.  
- **Autoencoders** – neural networks that learn compressed representations of input data.
