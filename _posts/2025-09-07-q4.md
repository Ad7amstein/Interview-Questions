**Classification algorithms vs. regression tasks**  

## Why classification algorithms don’t work for regression  

Classification algorithms are designed to predict *discrete class labels*, while regression tasks require predicting *continuous values*. Applying classification algorithms directly to regression problems would result in invalid or meaningless predictions.

## Examples of algorithms not suitable for regression

- **Logistic Regression** → Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm (predicts probabilities for discrete classes, not continuous outcomes).  
- **Naïve Bayes** → Based on Bayes’ theorem for categorical outcomes; it cannot output continuous numerical predictions.  

## Key takeaway  

{: .box-note}  

**Note:** Mny algorithms have regression counterparts (e.g., Logistic Regression vs Linear Regression, SVC vs SVR, Classification Tree vs Regression Tree, k-NN Classifier vs k-NN Regressor).

### Warning  

{: .box-warning}  
**Warning:** Don’t assume algorithms with “regression” in their name (like Logistic Regression) are suitable for regression tasks. They may be classification methods instead.
