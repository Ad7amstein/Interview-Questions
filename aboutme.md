### My story  

I‚Äôm a graduate in Artificial Intelligence from Cairo University, where I explored the intersection of data, machine learning, and practical applications.  

Some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on include:  

- **Arabic Newspaper Analysis**: Built an AI-powered system for newspaper layout detection, article/ad segmentation, OCR-based text extraction, and semantic ordering using DocLayout-YOLO, Azure OCR, and fine-tuned LLMs.  
- **THOTRON (Graduation Project)**: Designed and deployed an AI-powered idea management platform for group discussions with real-time clustering, paraphrasing, and summarization using Hugging Face, CrewAI, and LoRA fine-tuning.  
- **Quiz Generator**: Created an AI-powered tool that generates quizzes from text/PDFs in seconds, integrating LangChain, Hugging Face, and CrewAI for quality-controlled question generation.  
- **Deep Facial Recognition**: Developed a Siamese network model with PyTorch achieving 98%+ accuracy on a facial recognition dataset.  

Beyond projects, I create educational content and mentor peers, aiming to make AI concepts more accessible and practical.
